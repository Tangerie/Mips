*This is not a full assembler, it takes in mips files (with custom stuff) and assembles it to an intermediary format that can be used by future programs*

# Assembler
What does it need to do?

- Take in a `.mips` file and apply lexical analysis
- Track all data used in a program and coallate
- Alert to errors

# Future
- Another program should be able to use this data to create a `.s` MIPS file for submission to Uni
